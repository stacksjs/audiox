## Testing

## Audio Processing Tests
- Test all supported audio formats (WAV, MP3, AAC)
- Verify audio quality and characteristics after conversion
- Test with various bitrates and sample rates
- Validate channel configurations (mono, stereo)

## Stream Processing Tests
- Test stream-based audio processing
- Verify buffer handling and memory usage
- Test with different chunk sizes
- Validate stream error handling

## Metadata Tests
- Test reading and writing metadata
- Verify metadata preservation during conversion
- Test with various metadata fields
- Handle special characters in metadata

## Performance Tests
- Test processing of large audio files
- Measure memory usage during processing
- Verify stream processing efficiency
- Test concurrent audio processing

## Integration Tests
- Test FFmpeg integration
- Verify CLI functionality
- Test configuration loading
- Validate error handling scenarios

## Test Data
- Use standardized test audio files
- Include various audio formats
- Provide test files with metadata
- Include edge case test files

- Write tests for all functions, types, interfaces, and ensure examples are accurate
- The `./test` directory is where the tests are stored
- Use `bun test` to run the tests
- Use bun native modules for testing from `import { x, y, z } from 'bun:test'`
